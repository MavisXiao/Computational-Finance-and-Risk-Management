In this project, our team developed a Robo-advisor chatbot using the IBM Cloud platform Watson Assistant to operate as an investment counselor with potential clients. 
During the conversation, we aim to let our clients express their preferences and willingness, and the Robo-advisor Chatbot will make an investment suggestion, 
such as a recommended portfolio strategy.
